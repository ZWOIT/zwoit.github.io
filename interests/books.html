            <p class="content_body"> 
                The first book of the series, <i>The Shadow of What Was Lost</i>, was gifted to me over the holiday season of 2024.  
                Time travel <i>and</i> fantasy? Sign me up.  This book was very remniscent of fantasy books I grew up reading but is not a young adult novel.  
                This was the first book that James Islington, the author of the series, has ever written and published.  There are a few redundant tropes and 
                obvious indicators of a green writer. However, I blazed through the first book before I bothered to reasearch it's author.  <i>An Echo of Things to Come</i>, 
                book two, and <i>The Light of All That Falls</i>, book 3, continued to be page turners. Enjoyment, for me, came from solid magical mechanics, rich                     worldbuilding, and central theme of time travel that doesn't create any continuity errors.  Each book in this series wraps up in a satisfying 
                conclusion while still leaving a small inkling of wonder and mystery.  I also enjoyed seeing James' writing style change from book to book as his 
                writing skills continued to improve from a phenomenal baseline as a new author.
