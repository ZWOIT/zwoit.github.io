            <p class="content_body"> 
            Taco Tuesday comes with a lot of prep work and, as a result, I have an adverse reaction to making any sides. I'm also forgetful. On the odd 
            occassion I remember to make a side dish it's usually this corn bake recipe and rice.  Most of the ingredients I have laying around and this dish allows, nay, 
            <i>demands</i> you to expirement with the seasoning and ingredients.  
            </br></br>
            Canned corn works great, any cheese will do, and the onions don't have to be green.  Fresh lime, or lime juice that's been in the fridge forever,
            definitely rounds out the flavor profile. Prep is super quick but it does take a while to bake.  I always start with this dish and before I move
            onto the main event.
            </br></br>
            Kids also enjoy this if you don't make it too spicy (unless your kids are badass heat demons). I always add heat to my portion with Chalula or something stronger.

            If you've never had a <i>Dutch Baby</i> you are seriously missing out.  These are basically extra thick boi crepes.  I've made variation of this recipe the most 
            Saturdays over the last few years.  My family always looks forward to these.
            </br></br>
            Like crepes, the array of toppings can be sweet or savory.  If you're going savory then cut back on the sugar and vanilla this recipe calls for.  We always 
            go hard on the sweet side with lemon butter, fresh fruits (raspberries/blackberries/blueberries or any combo), and topped with some powdered sugar.  
            </br></br>
            I can usually put away 1/2 to an entire <i>Dutch Baby</i> and the leftovers make good snackings throughout the day.  I don't see myself getting
            sick of this recipe anytime soon.
