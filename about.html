        "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - Arthur C. Clarke<br>
      </br>
        I was born and raised in Montana, where the outdoors was my backyard. I wish I could say I was a lifelong tech enthusiast — soldering boards before I could drive or compiling code before I turned 18 — but that just wasn’t the case. However, I am very grateful for my upbringing.  Most of my youth was spent training for sports, volunteering, scouting, skiing, rafting, and playing music — though I’ll admit I also logged more than a few late-night hours on video games.
        </br>
        My early passion was helping others. I studied Human Physiology at Gonzaga University, envisioning a career in healthcare. Summers and weekends were spent working as a physical therapy aide and volunteering as an EMT-B. I loved caring for people, watching them heal, and learning what resilience of the human body looks like. But as graduation approached, I realized that holding someone else’s life in my hands carried a weight I didn't desire to bear.<br>
        </br>
        After some wandering, I found my way into information technology. At first, I was just a curious user asking: How does this work? Why does it break? Can I make this happen across every computer? One solved question led to three new ones, and before long, I was engineering systems, architecting processes, leading cybersecurity incident responses, and “doing the needful.”         
        </br>
        </br>
        Despite the knowledge I’ve gained, when I step back and take it all in, it still looks like magic.
        </br>
        </br>
        Today, I live on the Olympic Peninsula with my wife, son, and daughter. When I’m not working, you’ll likely find me outdoors, experimenting in the kitchen, or tinkering on a personal tech project.
