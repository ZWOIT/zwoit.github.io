        "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - Arthur C. Clarke<br>

        Being born and raised in Montana, with a vast love for nature and the outdoors as my backyard, you wouldn't typically find me within four walls. I wish I could say I've a tech enthusiast from an early age, sottered my first board before I could drive, or compiled my first program before turning 18 years old - but that just wasn't the case. Most of my youth was spent training for sports, volunteering, scouting, practicing for band/choir, skiing, hiking, rafting, and working.  Okay, I might have spent a decent amount of time playing video games when I should have been sleeping, too. </br>
      </br>
      I have always been passionate about helping others.  Healthcare seemd like an fascinating and rewarding career path.  I decided to major in Human Physiology at Gonzaga University with some vision of a clinical position after college (physical therapist, physicians assistant, etc).  While in school, summers and weekends were spent working as a physical therapy aid and volunteering as an EMT-B.  I loved taking care of others and watching them get better.  However, before I graduated, I had decided the responsibility of another human's life was too much.  I had witnessed death, and helped save lives, and discovered a long term career in clinical healthcare was not sustainable.<br>
      </br>
      Eventually I ended up in an information technology position.  I had been drawn to technology throughout my life.
